In addition to the repuirements file, you will have to build NicLink,
and populate NicLink/nic_soft/niclink with (for my my system):
    
    _niclink.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

this is an modified EasyLink SDK ( https://github.com/miguno/EasyLinkSDK ) for
use with python.

you can do this with bash by running updateNicLink.sh
