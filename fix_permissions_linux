use with gnu/linux

In order to use NicLink as a user in the wheel group 
( group can be arbitrary )
You must give the user read and write permissions for the Chessnut air.
This can be done through a udev rule.

create a 99-chessnutair.rules file: /etc/udev/rules.d/99-chessnutair.rules,
with the following:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}:="2d80", /
ATTRS{idProduct}:="8002", GROUP="wheel", MODE="0660"

# set the permissions for device files
KERNEL=="hidraw*", GROUP="wheel", MODE="0660"

======== end =========

my chessnutair has the following properties, if your's differs, adjust.

ID:  {vendor id} 2d80 : {product id} 8002

mount poin: /dev/hidraw2

Good luck.

This gives wheel group access to all of your hidraw devices,
but wheel usualy has sudo access so they have that anyway with sudo
